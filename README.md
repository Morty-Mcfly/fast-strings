# fast-strings

The purpose of this project is to implement safe & efficient string support with little overhead. I want it to be better than std::string (I know its not going to happen but let me dream) in terms of performance, features, or both

This project is part of a series to simplify the C/C++ development process. I know there are standard libraries for much of what I'm doing, but the real goal is to learn about vectorization, multithreading, code safety, and get a fundamental grasp on how computers function. I want to get to the metal. Optimize the hell out of everything (without using assembly, because screw that)

# Planned Features
I used to be a Python developer and loved the ease of use, and wanted to bring it to C/C++, and hopefully make it better than the Python developers did, in terms of speed

# Planned functions

I know there's strlen, but I wanted to implement it using vectorization (which I wouldnt be suprised if strlen uses that)
